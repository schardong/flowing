## Getting started


**TL-DR**:If you just want to run the code, follow the steps below (assuming a UNIX-like system with Make installed). For more details, jump to `Setup and sample run` section.

```{sh}
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
...
```
